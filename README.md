# Using photorealistic 3D visualization to convey ecosystem restoration to the public

This repo is under development.

This repo contains example code accompanying the paper [Using photorealistic 3D visualization to convey ecosystem restoration to the public](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2025.1525331).

The file `viz_prep.ipynb` takes in modelled data (files included) to set up the landscape. It then prescribes source files for 3D objects used in the visualisation, as well as their placement and orientation within the landscape.

**Note** that we are not able to provide the files containing these 3D objects. These objects were modelled by [Ulco Glimmerveen](https://gallery.ulco-art.nl/) and Jacco de Kok, who hold the sole rights to their creations.
